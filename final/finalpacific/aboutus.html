          got it's start in 1995 when our founder, Isabel Breton, visited the
          Mongolian city of Ulaanbaatar and stayed in her very first yurt just
          outside of the city. She had never enjoyed camping growing up but
          still wanted to experience nature and found that staying in a yurt
          offered the experiences she was missing. Upon returning to the United
          States, she made it her mission to share her experiences with others
          and showcase that camping can be new, exciting, and luxurious. That's
          when she decided to bring luxury camping and yurts to the same
          California coast that she visited often as a child.

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        
        <p>
          We strive to reinvent your idea of camping. We understand that
          sometimes a vacation needs to be luxurious, relaxing, and a change of
          pace from busy city life. Gone are the days of pitching tents, hole in
          the ground toilets, and prepackaged camping food.
