    <title>My Favorite Beverage</title>

<body>
    <p>My favorite beverage is Dr. Pepper. I love all kinds of Dr. Pepper, but my favorite that I have tried is the limited edition Creamy Coconut version.
        The original Dr. Pepper is also very good and is a lot easier to find than the limited edition version. 
        All of my friends know when we go out to eat that I will ask for a Dr. Pepper with my meal.
        The taste is very unique but it has the underlying flavor of cherry and a hint of vanilla.
        It's always amazing to open up a can of Dr. Pepper at the end of a long day.</p>
